# Super Slot Machine

Super Slot Machine is a fake slot machine that simulates an actual slot machine and is complete with a spin lever, machine with five possible results per slot, a form to input balance and bet information, and a result form that tells the user if they won or not. 

Each piece of the page is controlled by JavaScript and changes styling with CSS media queries at five different breakpoints.

In order to spin the lever for the machine, the user needs to fill out both the balance and the bet information. If either the balance or the bet is entered with a non-number or left empty, the user will be alerted to input dollar amounts for both. If the bet that the user enters is more than the balance, the user will be alerted that they need to reduce it. The same bet will be applied to each line, so the user will need to be thinking of the bet amount multiplied by three in relation the balance. After the user successfully enters balance and bet information, the balance and bet will be displayed above the machine.
